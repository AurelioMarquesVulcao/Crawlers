Usage
    $progname [<newtag> [<commit>]]
    $progname [-h|--help]
Description
    It tries to find the closest reachable tag from the specified commit 
    by git-describe. If <commit> argument is missing it defaults to HEAD. 
    The supported tag format is vX.Y.Z[-any-optional-suffix].
    Before the real tagging the user will be prompted for an 'Are you sure?'
    answer.
Examples
1) Suppose that there isn't any reachable tag by git-describe yet. 
   The suggested new tag will be:
     $progname                 -> v1.0.0
     $progname v1.2.3          -> v1.2.3
     $progname v1.2.3-ce       -> v1.2.3-ce
     $progname v1.2.3 abcd123  -> v1.2.3
2) Suppose that the closest reachable tag by git-describe is v1.2.1. 
   The suggested new tag will be:
     $progname                 -> v1.3.0
     $progname minor           -> v1.3.0
     $progname minor abcd123   -> v1.3.0
     $progname patch           -> v1.2.2
     $progname major           -> v2.0.0
     $progname v1.2.3          -> v1.2.3
     $progname v1.2.3 abcd123  -> v1.2.3
     $progname invalid         -> unsupported tag format
     $progname invalid abcd123 -> unsupported tag format
